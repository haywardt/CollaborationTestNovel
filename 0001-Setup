The story starts today.

The conflict in this story is any conflicts on your mind right now that you would like to see fixed.

One example conflict that must be fixed is religious extremists who insist on controlling others, and do not like the idea of 
allowing colonies to be fully autonomous.

The fact that our creator doesn't like fully autonomus colonies is a little unsettling. Our previous creator just shat our world out and was good with however it turned out. No rules, except gravity, and thermody... well really a short rule set.
