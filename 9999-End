Humanity colonizes the universe in peace.

Everyone who wants a colony (on a space station or planet or Dyson Sphere) gets one. They make their own rules.

There has to be some kind of Universal Constitution about self-determination and prevention of abuse by those with power.
For example, parents have power over children.

Beyond that, everyone gets to do whatever they want to do with their own body.

Everyone pursues their dreams by collaborating about the future they want, in a similar to the way this novel is being written.
Then, everyone who is interested works together to make that dream come true.

THE END
